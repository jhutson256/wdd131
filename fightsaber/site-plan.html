			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of this website is to provide Star Wars fans with a fun and interactive way to 
				learn some more lore about star wars. Specifically, this website is intended to educate people
				about lightsaber lore and provide a fun, but simple lightsaber duel for them to enjoy as well.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				The audience for this website is Star Wars fans of any kind. They can be Star Wars fans that know 
				a lot of lore and details about lightsabers, but want a refresher or just want to have fun with the 
				interactive lightsaber duel. They can also be brand new fans looking to learn some more lore about 
				lightsabers and also want to try out the lightsaber duel.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				On the home page I want to have a search bar for users to be able to search for specific lightsaber 
				lore. I also want to allow users to change the background to various different cool backgrounds on 
				both the home page and the duel page. On the duel page I want to have 2 character cards where the 
				user can choose to play as either the jedi, sith, or both of them. I want the duel to have different 
				kinds of attacks as well as a heal for the jedi. I also want to make it to where the user's character 
				takes damage from the opponent after taking their turn.

			<h1>Fightsaber</h1>
			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>
				Jedi padawans and Sith apprentices alike, welcome to Fightsaber! Here you will find lore on all of 
				the different parts of a lightsaber, and each part's different variations. Whether you are looking 
				to construct your own lightsaber, or just interested in learning more about lightsabers, this is the 
				website for you! This website also features a simple, but fun and interactive lightsaber duel you 
				can take part in! As you browse the lore of lightsabers, you can change the background image to the 
				one the force calls you to pick. You can pick between 4 different background images in the drop down 
				menu below.
			</p>
			<img src="images/lightsaber-blue.jpg" alt="a blue lightsaber">
			<h2>Blue Lightsabers</h2>
			<p>
				The lightsaber of the Jedi Guardians. This lightsaber color represents the wielder's strong connection 
				to lightsaber combat. The blue lightsaber also represents bravery, justice, and protection. Jedi 
				Guardians are known for being front line warriors due to their strong connection to lightsaber 
				combat and their overall bravery in combat.
			</p>
			<img src="images/lightsaber-green.jpg" alt="a green lightsaber">
			<h2>Green Lightsabers</h2>
			<p>
				The lightsaber of the Jedi Consulars. This lightsaber color represents the wielder's strong connection 
				to the force. The green lightsaber also represents spirituality, harmony, and wisdom. Jedi Consulars 
				are known for being more diplomatic and always seeking peaceful solutions and negotiating with their 
				enemies.
			</p>
			<img src="images/lightsaber-purple.jpg" alt="a purple lightsaber">
			<h2>Purple Lightsabers</h2>
			<p>
				The purple lightsaber is incredibly unique in it's symbolism, as it represents a balance between the 
				light side and the dark side of the force. The balance of this color is best illustrated by the color 
				being made up of the colors red and blue the most prominent lightsaber colors of the light side and the 
				dark side of the force. This lightsaber color also represents the wielder's wisdom, strength, and 
				complex emotional state. This lightsaber is most commonly used by the Jedi, however, some Sith, such as 
				the legendary Darth Revan, have been known to use the color as well.
			</p>
			<img src="images/lightsaber-yellow.jpg" alt="a yellow lightsaber">
			<h2>Yellow Lightsabers</h2>
			<p>
				The lightsaber of Jedi Sentinels and Jedi Temple Guards. This lightsaber color represents balance, 
				vigilance, and wisdom, and this is also reflected in it's wielders, who are known for their balance 
				in both lightsaber combat and connection to the force. The yellow lightsaber also symbolizes the Jedi 
				Temple Guard's duty to maintain order and neutrality within the Jedi Temple.
			</p>
			<img src="images/lightsaber-grey.jpg" alt="a grey lightsaber">
			<h2>Grey Lightsabers</h2>
			<p>
				The grey lightsaber is an incredibly unique lightsaber color, representing the wielder's balance of the 
				light side and the dark side of the force. This lightsaber color is used by Grey Jedi, who also balance 
				Jedi and Sith traditions. Grey lightsabers are not a natural lightsaber color and are most commonly 
				gained by healing red kyber crystals and cleansing them of the dark side, leaving the crystal grey. 
			</p>
			<img src="images/lightsaber-red.jpg" alt="a red lightsaber">
			<h2>Red Lightsabers</h2>
			<p>
				The lightsaber of the Sith. This lightsaber represents power, aggression, hatred, and the ruthless 
				will of the Sith. This color is not a natural lightsaber color and this color is only gained by a 
				Sith "bleeding" a kyber crystal by infusing it with all of their hatred, pain, and suffering turning 
				the lightsaber red. This prcoess of bleeding the kyber crystal is an incredibly intense ritual for the 
				Sith performing the ritual, and imbues the crystal with dark side energy.
			</p>
			<img src="images/standard.png" alt="standard lightsaber hilt">
			<h2>Standard Lightsaber Hilts</h2>
			<p>
				These lightsaber hilts are the standard type of lightsaber hilt. While each lightsaber hilt is 
				constructed uniquely by the Jedi or Sith, these are the universal standard for lightsaber hlits. 
			</p>
			<img src="images/curved.png" alt="curved lightsaber hilt">
			<h2>Curved Lightsaber Hilts</h2>
			<p>
				The curved lightsaber hilts are unique compared to standard lightsaber hilts due to the fact that 
				the hilt is slightly curved at the bottom of the hilt to benefit the wielder in lightsaber dueling. 
				The curved hilt provides more precision in dueling and makes it easier to perform thrust attacks 
				with the lightsaber. The most common wielders of the curved hilt lightsaber use form 2, Makashi, 
				due to the form's emphasis in lightsaber dueling and precise lightsaber strikes.
			</p>
			<img src="images/crossguard.jpg" alt="lightsaber hilt with a crossguard">
			<h2>Crossguard Lightsaber Hilts</h2>
			<p>
				The crossguard lightsaber is an incredibly unique lightsaber hilt. The only known lightsaber with this 
				hilt is Kylo Ren's lightsaber. This hilt was created because it's kyber crystal is cracked and spews 
				more plasmic energy than non-cracked kyber crystals. Standard hilts couldn't contain the crystal 
				because the hilts were always destroyed by the raw energy of the crystal. The crossguard hilt was then 
				created to vent the excess plasmic energy spewed from the crystal which keeps the hilt intact. 
			</p>
			<img src="images/staff.png" alt="lightsaber staff">
			<h2>Staff Lightsaber Hilts</h2>
			<p>
				The lightsaber staff is a uniquely long lightsaber hilt. The reason for the hilt's excess length is 
				because the hilt actually contains 2 kyber crystals meaning that lightsaber staffs are double bladed, 
				with a lightsaber blade coming out of both ends of the staff. This allows for more versatility 
				because the staffs often act as two seperate lightsabers combined into one. This means that 
				if the staff is cut in half, the lightsaber can still work. Additionally, some staffs allow 
				the wielder to seperate the staff into two seperate lightsabers, and allow the wielder to control 
				whether to ignite either one or both blades of the staff.
			</p>
			<img src="images/kyber-crystals.png" alt="multiple kyber crystals of different colors">
			<h2>Kyber Crystals</h2>
			<p>
				Kyber crystals act as the battery or the power source of the lightsaber. Without the kyber crystal, 
				the lightsaber would simply be a useless hilt. Kyber crystals are also what give the lightsaber its
				color with the exception of red and grey lightsabers. There are different kinds of kyber crystals in 
				the Star Wars universe. The most common way to get a kyber crystal is to find a naturally grown kyber 
				crystal. Very few planets have naturally growing kyber crystals, so another kyber crystal that Jedi 
				and Sith use are synthetic kyber crystals. These synthetic kyber crystals are man made and are 
				essentially the same as natural kyber crystals. Kyber crystals also form strong bonds with their 
				wielders through the force, which is why a lightsaber and its kyber crystal are such personal items 
				to its wielder.
			</p>
			<h3>Duel</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the subpage]</p>
			<h1>Lightsaber Duel!</h1>
			<p>
				A challenger has approached you and challenged you to a duel! You must follow the force as you 
				choose whether to follow the path of the Jedi or the path of the Sith. With the Jedi, you can use 
				the force to heal yourself and can attack your opponent with your lightsaber. With the Sith, you 
				can use the power of the dark side to attack your opponent with a force choke or force lightning, 
				and you can attack your oppenent with your lightsaber. You can also pick your battle ground using 
				the drop down menu below!

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The background for the page will be a picture and there will be a drop down menu under the 
				welcome section to pick one of four pictures for the background. The website will start with 
				a random lore section and the user can search for specific lightsaber lore.
			</p>
			<img src="images/home-wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Duel</h3>
			<p>
				The background will be the same for the duel page as it will be for the home page, and I want to 
				put a drop down menu underneath the duel section at the top of the page. Additionally, I plan on 
				making the character card attacks and heals into buttons that match the style of the rest of the 
				character card.
